A catch rate generator for the Pokemon Game Boy/DS games in C. Because I am unemployed (bored) this summer, and if this doesn't look good on my resume I don't know what will. As of now, works on the console. On a git repo because git (also, Github. Too) is slick.

Uses info on Pokemon mechanics (from the good Pokemaniacs at Bulbapedia) at:

bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Catch_rate

Advice, comments, support welcomed. Fork as many times as you like, fork with your friends, fork it with your friends, etc.

TODO:
~ Driver for console
~ (subdrivers for each generation?)
~ Create meaningful FAILURE messages (or scrap macro, maybe)
~ Comments (whoops, haha, how did that happen)
~ debug
~ add support for non-standard Poke Balls
~ debug again
~ add Generation V support
~ debug, again
~ replace "Catch Rate" and other Pokemon-specific bits of info you'd have to look up on Bulbapedia with "Pokemon" field (possibly using a database or table)
~ debug. again.
~ create GUI (in GTK+, maybe Java or just a web app+)
~ DEBUG. DEBUG. DEBUG.
~ do some mathy analysis to account for uncertainties in Max/Current HP (?)

~ ??? (debugging?)
~ Profit! (nope)

P.S. Pokemon is (C) Nintendo (I think? Maybe it's Game Freak, you tell me)
